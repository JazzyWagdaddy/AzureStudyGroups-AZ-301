# Design for Identity and Security (20-25%)

Start by completing the following course on openedx:
* [Designing for Identity and Security](https://aka.ms/openedx-AZ-301.1-about)

# Design Identity Management
May include but not limited to: Choose an identity management approach; design an identity delegation strategy, identity repository (including directory, application, systems, etc.); design self-service identity management and user and persona provisioning; define personas and roles; recommend appropriate access control strategy (e.g., attribute-based, discretionary access, history-based, identity-based, mandatory, organization-based, role-based, rule-based, responsibility-based).

**Note that the [Cloud Adoption Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/cloud-adoption/overview) and the [Azure security best practices and patterns](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/security-best-practices-and-patterns) documentation are the key materials to review for this exam objective.**

## Design Authorization
May include but not limited to: Choose an authorization approach; define access permissions and privileges; design secure delegated access (e.g., oAuth, OpenID, etc.); recommend when and how to use API Keys.

* Choose an authorization approach

## Design for Risk Prevention for Identity
May include but not limited to: Design a risk assessment strategy (e.g., access reviews, RBAC policies, physical access); evaluate agreements involving services or products from vendors and contractors; update solution design to address and mitigate changes to existing security policies, standards, guidelines and procedures.
